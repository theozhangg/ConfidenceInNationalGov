Exploring different machine learning models and techniques to predict the level of confidence in a national government based on the World Happiness Report dataset

I ultimately ended up using a gradient boosted decision tree that I tuned the hyperparameters of in multiple steps using GridSearchCV. I then explored more of the feature importance relationships of the final model I created.

Note: the cells that run GridSearchCV are commented out to save on runtime. The rsults of each are documented in markdown cells below.
